# üß≠ Navigator.ba - Automated Smoke Test Suite

## üìÑ Project Overview
This project contains automated smoke tests for the [Navigator.ba](https://www.navigator.ba) application.  
The tests verify critical functionalities like category navigation, map interactions, social media buttons, and language switching.

Automation is done using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **JUnit 5**.

- No user login is required for these tests since Navigator.ba does not have a login system.
- Browser window size is adjusted for responsive layout testing.
